Department Management System is software that is helpful for students as well as the college authorities. In the current system, all the activities are done manually. Its time saving and scalable. Our Department Management System deals with the various activities related to the Department. In the Department management system, we can view as a user and the user has two types of students and administrator.
The administrator has the power to add a new user and can edit the details entered. An admin can add faculty details department-wise. All students can search their basic details and attendance status with their respective roll numbers.
It can be used by educational institutes or colleges to maintain the records of department easily and helps them by automating regular administrative tasks. The creation and management of accurate, up-to-date information regarding a faculty's academic career is critically important in the university as well as college.
